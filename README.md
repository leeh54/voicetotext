This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Progress
- This project imported voice recognition and made own website layout.
- It saves the final transcript in the firebase store.
- However, duplicated final transcripts are stored in the firebase store and it was hard to transfer the transcripts into the pdf file.

### Success
- Voice recognition works ok.
- Made simple buttons so that people can start, stop recording their speech. Also, it resets.
- Successfully used material UI button with their icons.
- Successfully deployed and stored the final transcript into the storage.

### Next Step
- make available to export the final transcript into pdf file.
- revamp the layout design.
